		<h1><em> Panu Hejmadi </em> </h1>
		<p>I'm a first-year at Barnard College from Bangalore, India and I've lived here my entire life. I'm very passionate about education and education policy as a medium for change. </p>
		<br>
		<p> Over my high-school career, I've had three separate tutoring engagements. At Kenny Grammar School—a local under-resourced government school— I built and organised an accessible library for students of the school and worked with them to foster an interest in recreational reading. At Nirmala Shishu Bhavan—a home for children with cerebral palsy— I also tutored kids of varied age groups in Math and English. At my own high-school, I started an after-school robotics program for elementary and middle-schoolers— where a group of friends and I supported them in using Arduinos to bring their creative ideas to life. Further, I was also a presenter in and contributor to UNESCO's Happy Schools Project in South-East Asia. These experiences culminated into my work on 'The Inclusive Education Project' in my last year of high-school— where a group of friends and I researched social inclusion policies in schools of different kinds in order to develop a scalable framework for language-based inclusion policies across learning and schooling environments. </p>
		<br>
		<p>I'm also very passionate about writing and journalism and founded my school's first magazine, The Scribe— and served as Editor-in-Chief. In the past, I've also lead the organisation of my high-school's TEDx event. </p>
